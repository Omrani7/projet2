2. Backend API
Create Inquiry

Endpoint: POST /inquiries

Payload:

json
Copier
Modifier
{
  "studentId": 123,
  "propertyId": 456,
  "message": "Hi, I’m very interested in this S+2 near FSM. Can I view it tomorrow?"
}
Action:

Load Student, Property, derive its Owner.

Persist new Inquiry(student, owner, property, message, now()).

Send notification to the owner (see below).

List Inquiries for Owner

Endpoint: GET /owners/{ownerId}/inquiries

Returns all inquiries for that owner, with student info and message.

Owner Reply (basic MVP)

Endpoint: PUT /inquiries/{inquiryId}/reply

Payload:

json
Copier
Modifier
{
  "reply": "Thanks for your interest! Yes, you can visit tomorrow at 3 PM."
}
Action: update reply + replyTimestamp, notify student.

3. Notifications
Email Notifications (MVP)

On inquiry creation, send an email to the owner’s registered address with student name, property link, and message.

On owner reply, send an email to the student with the owner’s response.

In-App Alerts (Extension)

Use a simple toast/snackbar in the owner’s dashboard when they log in, showing “You have X new inquiries.”

Similarly, students see “Your inquiry #123 has a reply.”

4. Frontend Components
4.1 Student Side
InquiryFormComponent on the Property Detail page

Text field for message, “Send Inquiry” button.

On success: show “Your inquiry was sent!”

MyInquiriesComponent under the student profile

List each inquiry with property thumbnail, student message, and owner reply (if any).

4.2 Owner Side
OwnerInquiriesComponent in the Owner Dashboard

Table or list showing:

Property title

Student name & date

Student message

(If replied) Owner reply and timestamp

“Reply” button to open a small reply form inline.

5. Workflow Summary
Browse & Inquire

Student sees a listing → clicks “Inquire” → fills message → backend saves Inquiry.

Notify Owner

Owner gets an email and sees a badge in their dashboard.

Owner Responds

Owner clicks “Reply,” types response → backend saves reply.

Notify Student

Student gets an email and sees the reply in “My Inquiries.”

Next Steps

Student and owner finalize visit and payment offline.

After payment, owner clicks “Archive” on the property page to remove it from search results.

Student Flow (From browsing to inquiry and follow-up). Send Inquiry
Action: Student visits a property detail page → writes a message → clicks “Send Inquiry.”

System:

Checks if the student is authenticated.

Creates a new Inquiry linking Student, Property, and Owner.

Notifies the owner (email or in-app alert).

UI: Shows confirmation (“Inquiry sent”).

4. View Inquiries and Replies
Action: Student opens “My Inquiries” section.

System: Displays:

Property info

Inquiry message

Owner reply (if any)

Next Step: If owner responds, student contacts them to arrange a visit/payment.

5. Confirm Agreement (Offline)
Action: Student and owner meet, agree, and student pays.

System: No payment system is implemented (offline exchange).

Suggestion: Student could mark property as "Reserved" to flag interest (optional).Owner Flow (From listing to post-inquiry)
1. Login / Signup
Receive Inquiry
Action: A student submits an inquiry for one of the owner’s properties.

System:

Real-Time Notifications (WebSocket/STOMP)
Spring WebSocket with STOMP – Use Spring Boot’s built-in WebSocket support (spring-boot-starter-websocket) combined with STOMP messaging. Annotate a configuration class with @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker and configure a simple broker (e.g. with prefix “/topic” or “/queue”)
medium.com
spring.io
. This lets the backend push events (inquiries) to subscribed clients without polling. STOMP (the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) runs over WebSocket and is the standard Spring approach for real-time messages
spring.io
. Typical setup: one endpoint (e.g. /ws) with SockJS fallback, and use SimpMessagingTemplate.convertAndSendToUser(ownerUsername, "/queue/inquiries", payload) to target the specific owner’s queue. This is lightweight and aligns with Spring best practices
medium.com
spring.io
.
Angular STOMP Client – On the Angular side, use a STOMP-compatible library. For example, install @stomp/stompjs (the core STOMP client) and the RxStomp wrapper (@stomp/rx-stomp) or the ngx-stompjs integration. These libraries let you open a WebSocket, subscribe to the owner’s topic (e.g. /user/queue/inquiries), and react to incoming messages. They integrate with Angular’s RxJS (observables) for clean handling. The RxStomp guide shows how Angular apps can easily subscribe to Spring’s STOMP endpoints. Using these ensures a maintainable real-time channel with minimal boilerplate.
Best Practices: Use SockJS fallback for broad browser support, keep message payloads small (e.g. JSON with inquiry details), and secure the /ws endpoint so only authenticated users connect. Spring Security will propagate the user’s Principal to the WebSocket session, so the server can send messages to the correct user
docs.spring.io
.
Email Notifications (Spring Boot)
Spring Boot Mail (JavaMailSender) – The canonical way to send emails in Spring Boot is with spring-boot-starter-mail. This auto-configures a JavaMailSender bean when you set spring.mail.host (SMTP host) in application.properties
docs.spring.io
. Simply include the starter in your pom.xml or build.gradle (as shown in guides
geeksforgeeks.org
) and configure SMTP credentials (e.g. Gmail, AWS SES, SendGrid). Spring Boot’s mail abstraction handles MIME messages and templates if needed, and integrates well with templating engines (Thymeleaf/Freemarker) for rich email bodies. This approach is simple and reliable for sending notification emails.
Third-Party Email APIs – As an alternative, consider an API-based mail service (SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES) with Spring. These often provide a Spring Boot starter or can be used via their Java SDK. Using a service can improve deliverability (avoiding SMTP pitfalls) and simplifies setup. For example, Spring Cloud and third-party libraries let you use SendGrid by configuring API keys. However, for basic notifications, plain SMTP (via JavaMailSender) is often sufficient and has no extra cost.
Best Practices: Use asynchronous sending (don’t block the request thread). For example, call mail sending in a background task or use Spring’s @Async. Also, configure reasonable SMTP timeouts to avoid hung threads
docs.spring.io
.
In-App Notifications (Angular)
Angular Material SnackBar – If your app uses Angular Material, its MatSnackBar is a quick way to show toast notifications. It’s lightweight and accessible (ARIA-ready)
briantree.se
. Simply inject MatSnackBar into a component or service and call open('Message', 'Dismiss', { duration: 3000 }). It supports simple actions and auto-dismiss. It’s ideal for transient notifications (e.g. “Inquiry sent!”).
ngx-toastr (Toastr) – A popular open-source library for toast-style notifications. It provides more styling and configuration than basic SnackBar (colors for success/warning/error, position options, etc.)
geeksforgeeks.org
. To use it, install ngx-toastr and @angular/animations, import its module, and then show toasts in your components or via a shared NotificationService. Its consistency and ease of use make it a good choice for in-app alerts
geeksforgeeks.org
.
Custom Notification Service – For more control, implement an Angular service that holds a Subject or BehaviorSubject of notification messages. Components subscribe to this service to display notifications (e.g. in a top-bar or dropdown). When a WebSocket message arrives for a user, push it through this service. This pattern (observable-based global state) avoids tightly coupling components and centralizes notification logic.
Best Practices: Keep notifications unobtrusive. Use a global notification component placed near <app-root> so it can show alerts from anywhere. Unsubscribe from streams when components destroy. When showing a real-time inquiry, you might both push it into a notification list (or service) and use a toast/snackbar for immediate feedback.
PostgreSQL Schema & Data Model
Inquiry Table – Create a simple inquiries table to record each student inquiry. Include columns like id (PK), student_id (FK to users or students table), property_id (FK to properties), owner_id (FK to users or owners – often redundant if property has owner), message (text), created_at (timestamp), and a status/flag if needed. Use foreign key constraints to enforce integrity (so inquiries reference valid students/properties). Index the foreign keys for performance (e.g. on owner_id and property_id)
geeksforgeeks.org
. Proper indexing of FKs “can greatly speed up queries” involving those joins
geeksforgeeks.org
.
Notification Table (Optional) – If you want persistent in-app notifications, create a notifications table. This could have id, user_id (who should see it, e.g. the owner), text (notification message), link (optional URL, e.g. to the inquiry or property), is_read (boolean), and created_at. Then when an inquiry is made, insert into notifications. The owner’s notification panel can query this. Index user_id and perhaps (user_id, is_read). For a simple system, you might skip persistence and only push real-time alerts, but a DB table allows an audit trail or retry on missed events.
Best Practices: Always use foreign keys and data types consistently (e.g. use UUID if using UUID PKs). Postgres will auto-index primary keys but does not auto-index foreign-key columns; add indexes on the referencing side to optimize lookups
geeksforgeeks.org
. Use sensible column types (e.g. TEXT or VARCHAR for messages). If inquiries have attachments or rich content, consider a jsonb column or separate table.
Authentication & User Identification
Spring Security (JWT or Session) – Secure all endpoints (REST and WebSocket) with Spring Security. Use JWT tokens or HTTP sessions/cookies to authenticate users on login. In Angular, include the token in HTTP headers and WebSocket handshake headers. Spring Security will then attach the user’s Principal to requests
docs.spring.io
. Configure roles (e.g. ROLE_STUDENT, ROLE_OWNER) so that only owners receive owner-specific data. For example, only the owner of a property should be authorized to subscribe to /user/queue/inquiries.
WebSocket Principal – Because Spring Security propagates the HTTP principal to WebSockets
docs.spring.io
, you can use the authenticated username to route messages. The @MessageMapping handler can access Principal or you can send to a destination like "/user/{username}/queue/inquiries". This ensures that when a student makes an inquiry, the backend knows exactly which owner user to notify (based on the owner’s username or ID).
Angular Guard/Interceptor – In Angular, protect routes with an AuthGuard and store the user identity (JWT or user profile) in a service. Use an HTTP interceptor to attach the auth token to API calls. For WebSocket, pass the token in the query or header when connecting (the @stomp/stompjs client supports a connect with headers option).
Best Practices: Do not expose inquiry details to the wrong user. Always validate on the backend: check that student_id matches the authenticated student making the request, and that the owner_id matches the property’s actual owner. Avoid keeping long-lived secret keys on the client. Ensure the WebSocket endpoint is secured (e.g. CSRF disabled for /ws but require JWT). A concise guide on Spring Security + Angular shows how to tie them together
