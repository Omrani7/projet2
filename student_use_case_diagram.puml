In Tunisia, university students face significant challenges when searching for suitable accommodation and compatible roommates, often spending weeks or even months navigating fragmented rental markets, unreliable listings, and inefficient communication channels. The traditional approach to student housing involves time-consuming visits to multiple properties, reliance on word-of-mouth recommendations, and limited access to verified information about both properties and potential roommates. This process not only wastes valuable time that could be dedicated to academic pursuits but also frequently results in suboptimal living arrangements due to insufficient information and rushed decisions. 

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{UniNest}} addresses these critical pain points by providing a comprehensive digital platform that streamlines the entire student accommodation ecosystem in Tunisia. Our platform leverages advanced compatibility algorithms to match students with suitable roommates based on academic backgrounds, lifestyle preferences, and personal habits, while simultaneously offering a curated database of verified property listings with detailed information, high-quality images, and transparent pricing. By integrating intelligent recommendation systems, real-time communication tools, and comprehensive search filters, \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{UniNest}} transforms the traditionally stressful and time-consuming process of finding student accommodation into an efficient, reliable, and user-friendly experience. The platform not only saves students countless hours of searching but also increases the likelihood of successful, long-term housing arrangements by facilitating informed decision-making through detailed property information, roommate compatibility scoring, and streamlined inquiry management between students and property owners.

\chapter{General Context \& Preliminary Study}
\thispagestyle{fancy}



\section{Introduction}
This chapter introduces the \textbf{UniNest} platform, detailing the context and motivations behind its development. It begins by examining the current landscape of student housing solutions in Tunisia, highlighting the fragmented nature of existing tools and the challenges students face in securing suitable accommodation and compatible roommates.

\vspace{1em}
Subsequently, the chapter outlines the structure of the \textbf{UniNest} project, emphasizing its objectives to centralize and streamline the housing search and roommate matching processes. By addressing the identified needs, \textbf{UniNest} aims to provide a cohesive, user-friendly platform tailored to the unique requirements of Tunisian university students.

\section{Subject Presentation}

\subsection{General Context}
This document presents the development of the \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{UniNest}} platform, a solution crafted to simplify student housing searches near higher education institutions across Tunisia. Designed as part of the final-year project for the Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and Information Systems at the Faculty of Sciences of Monastir (FSM). The platform was envisioned and built with the goal of addressing a recurring issue faced by university students—finding suitable accommodation close to their campus without relying on fragmented or unreliable sources.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Tunisian university  \cite{gamma} students face major difficulties in finding reliable and suitable accommodation due to fragmented rental markets, unverified listings, and inefficient search methods. The lack of a centralized platform leads to time-consuming processes, poor roommate matching, and increased stress—negatively impacting students' academic performance and well-being.

\subsection{Project Objectives}
\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{UniNest}} aims to revolutionize the student accommodation experience in Tunisia by providing a comprehensive digital platform that streamlines property discovery and roommate matching. The project seeks to eliminate time-consuming traditional search methods through intelligent compatibility algorithms, verified property listings, and efficient communication tools, ultimately enabling students to make informed housing decisions quickly and focus on their academic success.

\section{The Methodology and Adopted Formalisms}
For this project, we adopted the Waterfall\cite{} methodology, a linear and sequential software development approach. This choice was driven by the well-defined nature of the project's requirements and the need for a structured process with clearly demarcated phases.

\section{Previous Studies}
Several existing methods for student housing search were examined to identify their strengths and shortcomings. Currently, the most commonly used solutions involve informal searches through Facebook groups or collecting property owners' phone numbers. While these approaches may work in limited contexts, they lack structure, accuracy, and scalability. They often result in scattered information, outdated listings, and a time-consuming experience for students looking for reliable accommodation near their university or institute.

\subsection{Facebook Groups/Market Place}
The most popular announcements source for property for students to search and for owners to publish.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{figures/facebook.jpg}
    \caption{Facebook\textsuperscript{[2]} platform interface}
    \label{fig:facebook}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unlimited amount of announcements (published in groups/market place)
    \item Easy to find room mates (many students already looking)
    \item Owners can publish announcements and attract clients very easily
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time-consuming and poor filtering:} Students often waste time browsing groups and marketplaces due to the absence of proper search and filtering tools.
    \item \textbf{Irrelevant Listings:} Many announcements are unrelated to the group's main purpose, making the search process more difficult.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Information and Images:} Numerous listings are missing essential details such as property images or addresses, making it hard to evaluate the offer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mubawab}
Mubawab\textsuperscript{[3]} is a leading real estate portal in Tunisia, offering a wide range of rental listings across the country. It is commonly used by individuals and agencies to publish property announcements.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.12\textwidth]{figures/mubawab-log.png}
    \caption{Mubawab platform logo}
    \label{fig:mubawab}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Well-structured and organized listings with all necessary property information.
    \item Advanced filtering options, user-friendly interface, and a large volume of announcements.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Not student-oriented:} Most properties are targeted at families or vacation rentals, not students.
    \item \textbf{High pricing:} Listings are often priced above student budgets due to agency involvement.
    \item \textbf{No roommate search support:} The platform lacks any features or tools to help students find roommates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tayara}
Tayara\textsuperscript{[4]} is Tunisia's largest classifieds site, a multi‑purpose marketplace.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.14\textwidth]{figures/tayara-logo.png}
    \caption{Tayara platform logo}
    \label{fig:tayara}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Large number of listings with regularly updated property information.
    \item Effective filtering and search functionalities for easier navigation.
    \item Includes dedicated sections for \textit{"Étudiantes"} and \textit{"Colocations"}, allowing students to browse or post ads for studios and shared accommodations.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Not focused solely on property listings:} The platform features a wide range of announcement types, which can dilute the property search experience.
    \item \textbf{Limited student targeting:} Many announcements are geared toward families or vacation rentals rather than student housing needs.
    \item \textbf{Weak roommate search support:} Few colocation announcements are available, and the feature is not widely adopted among students.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Proposed Solution}
\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{UniNest}} is an all-in-one platform designed to simplify the process of property discovery and rental for university students. It aims to centralize listings, provide intuitive search, roommates finding and filtering tools, and enhance the overall housing experience for students by addressing the limitations of existing fragmented solutions. Tailored specifically for the student demographic, \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{UniNest}} brings together landlords and students in a structured, user-friendly, and affordable environment—eliminating the inefficiencies of social media groups and generic real estate platforms.

%\subsection{Architecture}
The \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{UniNest}} platform follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC)\textsuperscript{[5]} architectural pattern, which provides a clear separation of concerns and promotes maintainable, scalable code.

\section{Conclusion}
\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{UniNest}} unifies property listings, proximity filters, and roommate matching into a single platform, replacing fragmented Facebook groups and classifieds with an intuitive map-and-list interface. It streamlines housing discovery and communication for Tunisian students, delivering targeted search results and real-time messaging in one secure environment.

The present report is the result of an end-of-study project carried out to develop UniNest, a comprehensive digital platform designed to revolutionize student accommodation search and roommate matching in Tunisia. This work was an opportunity to create a web-based application that is essentially used to help Tunisian university students find suitable housing and compatible roommates efficiently.

This report details all the steps we have taken to achieve the desired results, from initial problem analysis through system design, implementation, and testing phases.

This project has been personally and professionally beneficial. It provided me with an opportunity to highlight my skills acquired during my academic journey, to deepen and improve my full-stack development knowledge, and to discover new technologies including Angular, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and automated web scraping with Playwright. The implementation of features such as compatibility algorithms, inquiry management systems, and interactive property discovery has significantly enhanced my technical expertise.

This project has also provided me with valuable experience in an environment that fosters systematic problem-solving, comprehensive system architecture design, database optimization, and end-to-end project management. The development of both frontend and backend components, along with the integration of external data sources through web scraping, has given me practical experience in modern software development practices.

However, like any other work, this work cannot claim perfection.

We can offer as perspectives:

\textbf{Enhanced Search Filters}: Expanding the current property search functionality with more detailed filtering options such as amenities, property type specifications, and proximity to specific university campuses.

\textbf{Improved Compatibility Algorithm}: Refining the existing roommate matching system by incorporating additional compatibility factors and user feedback to enhance matching accuracy.

\textbf{Advanced Messaging Features}: Extending the current conversation system with file sharing capabilities and message status indicators to improve communication between students and property owners.

\textbf{Enhanced Admin Dashboard}: Expanding the current admin panel with more comprehensive analytics and reporting features to better monitor platform usage and user engagement.
