# Inquiry Feature Backend Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Backend Implementation

#### 1.1. Data Model (Entity)
- ‚úÖ Created `InquiryStatus` enum with states: PENDING_REPLY, REPLIED, CLOSED
- ‚úÖ Created `Inquiry` entity with:
  - Proper JPA annotations and relationships
  - Database indexes for performance
  - Auto-updating reply timestamp and status

#### 1.2. Repository  
- ‚úÖ Created `InquiryRepository` with methods:
  - findByOwnerIdOrderByTimestampDesc
  - findByStudentIdOrderByTimestampDesc
  - findByPropertyId
  - findByIdWithDetails (with eager fetching)
  - countUnreadInquiriesForOwner

#### 1.3. DTOs
- ‚úÖ Created all required DTOs:
  - `InquiryDTO` - Main DTO for responses
  - `UserBasicDTO` - Basic user info for nested objects
  - `PropertyListingBasicDTO` - Basic property info
  - `InquiryCreateDTO` - For creating inquiries
  - `InquiryReplyDTO` - For owner replies

#### 1.4. Service
- ‚úÖ Created `InquiryService` with:
  - createInquiry method (now restricts inquiries to OWNER properties only)
  - getInquiriesForOwner method
  - getInquiriesForStudent method  
  - replyToInquiry method
  - markInquiryStatus method
  - getUnreadInquiryCount method
  - Email notification integration
  - WebSocket notification integration

#### 1.5. Controller
- ‚úÖ Created `InquiryController` with endpoints:
  - POST /api/v1/inquiries - Create inquiry
  - GET /api/v1/inquiries/owner - Get owner inquiries
  - GET /api/v1/inquiries/student - Get student inquiries
  - PUT /api/v1/inquiries/{id}/reply - Reply to inquiry
  - PUT /api/v1/inquiries/{id}/status - Update status
  - GET /api/v1/inquiries/owner/unread-count - Get unread count

#### 1.6. Notification System
##### 1.6.1. Email Notifications
- ‚úÖ Extended `EmailService` with generic sendEmail method
- ‚úÖ Integrated email notifications in InquiryService
- ‚úÖ Added @Async support for non-blocking email sending

##### 1.6.2. Real-Time Notifications (WebSocket/STOMP)
- ‚úÖ Created `WebSocketConfig` with STOMP configuration
- ‚úÖ Created `WebSocketNotificationService` for real-time notifications
- ‚úÖ Integrated WebSocket notifications in InquiryService
- ‚úÖ Created `WebSocketSecurityConfig` to secure WebSocket endpoints
- ‚úÖ Added spring-boot-starter-websocket dependency

#### 1.7. Archive Functionality
- ‚úÖ Added archiveProperty method to PropertyListingService
- ‚úÖ Added PUT /api/v1/properties/{id}/archive endpoint

#### 1.8. Security Configuration
- ‚úÖ All endpoints have proper @PreAuthorize annotations
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control implemented
- ‚úÖ WebSocket endpoints secured

#### 1.9. Global Exception Handling
- ‚úÖ Created `GlobalExceptionHandler` with @RestControllerAdvice
- ‚úÖ Created `ErrorResponse` DTO for standardized errors
- ‚úÖ Handles all common exceptions with proper HTTP status codes

## Important Business Logic Updates ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚úÖ **Inquiry Restrictions**: Inquiries can now only be made for properties with `sourceType = OWNER`
  - Scraped properties cannot receive inquiries
  - Clear error message provided when attempting to inquire about non-owner properties

## Backend Complete! üéâ

The entire backend implementation for the inquiry feature is now complete, including:
- Core functionality (entities, repositories, services, controllers)
- Email notifications
- Real-time WebSocket notifications
- Security and authorization
- Error handling
- Business logic restrictions

## Next Steps üìã

### Frontend Implementation (Phase 2):
1. Create Angular services:
   - `inquiry.service.ts` - REST API integration
   - `websocket.service.ts` - WebSocket/STOMP client

2. Create UI components:
   - Inquiry form on property details page
   - "My Inquiries" page for students
   - "Owner Inquiries" dashboard for owners
   - Real-time notification display

3. Implement state management for inquiries and notifications

4. Add routing and navigation updates

### Testing:
- Unit tests for InquiryService
- Integration tests for InquiryController
- WebSocket connection tests

## Notes
- Email notifications will log to console in development if SMTP is not configured
- WebSocket notifications require frontend client implementation to receive
- All endpoints follow RESTful conventions and have proper error handling
- Inquiries are restricted to owner-listed properties only
